its showing unknown option forcee deployement

Edit
Ah, the parameter name is different! Use --force-new-deployment (with dashes, not force):

bash
aws ecs update-service --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_SERVICE_NAME --enable-execute-command --force-new-deployment
If that still doesn't work, try without the force deployment flag first:

bash
aws ecs update-service --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_SERVICE_NAME --enable-execute-command
The --force-new-deployment just ensures new tasks are created immediately with ECS Exec enabled. Without it, you'd need to wait for the service to naturally replace tasks.

What's the exact error now?





an error occure when calling update service operation the service couldent be updated because a valid taskrolearn  is not being used, specify the valueid task role in your task defination and try again

Edit
This error means your ECS task definition doesn't have the required IAM role for ECS Exec. You need to add a task role with specific permissions.

Fix this by updating your Task Definition:
Step 1: Create/Find the Required IAM Role
Go to IAM Console → Roles
Look for a role with ECS Task Role trust policy, or create a new one
The role needs this permission policy: AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy
For ECS Exec, it also needs: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
Step 2: Update Task Definition
Go to ECS Console → Task Definitions
Click your task definition → Create new revision
Scroll to Task role dropdown
Select the IAM role you found/created
Click Create
Step 3: Update Service to Use New Task Definition
Go to your Service → Update
Under Task Definition, select the new revision
Click Update
Quick IAM Role Creation (if needed):
IAM → Roles → Create role
Select AWS service → Elastic Container Service → Elastic Container Service Task
Attach policies:
AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy
AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
Name it something like ecsTaskRole
After updating the task definition with the task role, try the ECS Exec command again.

Which step do you need help with first - creating the IAM role or updating the task definition?
